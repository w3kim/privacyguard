- open command prompt and execute command

### 6. Device does not automatically show up when running app since drivers don't get installed:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16596877/android-studio-doesnt-see-device

- Steps to resolve:
- If you using Windows, the device won't show up because of driver issue.
- Go to device manager (just search it using Start) and look for any devices showing an error. Many androids will show as an unknown USB device and comes with exclamation mark. Select that device and try to update the drivers for it.
- But before that, you have to update your sdk manager and make sure Google USB Driver package is installed.
- When done, the driver files are downloaded into the \extras\google\usb_driver\ directory. Hints: Search "android_winusb.inf" under Windows Start and Open File Location to get the directory mentioned.
- Open up your device manager, navigate to your android device, right click on it and select Update Driver Software then select Browse driver software. Follow the file location path previously to install Google USB Driver.
- Restart Android Studio and Developer Options in your android device and reconnect USB.

### 7. Checking SQLite Databases:
-	Go to Tools -> DDMS or click the Device Monitor icon next to SDK Manager in Tool bar.
Device Monitor window will open.     

-	In File Explorer tab click data -> data -> your project name. After that your databases file will open . click "pull a file from device" icon. Save the file using .db extension.

-	Open FireFox, Press Alt , Tools->SQLiteManager.
Follow Database -> connect to Database -> browse your database file and click ok. Your SQLite file will opened now.

- This is because the number of declared methods is too high. Android generally only allow app to have under 65K methods. 
- Simple and easy (but improper) way is to add this to build.gradle (app module)

		android {
   			...
   			defaultConfig {
      		...
      			multiDexEnabled true
   			}
		} 
- The better solution is to look at your library dependencies and recude unnecessary libraries
